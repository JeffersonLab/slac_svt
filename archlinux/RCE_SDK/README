RCE SDK for ARM Linux
=================

Copyright (C) 2016  Stanford University

Introduction
============

The RCE SDK for Linux provides the API, libraries, and tools necessary
to develop software for the RCE platform.  It contains pre-built
images, header files, and tools to create custom images.

All included and generated SDK images are targeted for one of the
following platforms:

1) the RCE hardware executing a supported linux operating system.
2) x86 hardware executing a supported linux operating system

SDK Concepts
============

Platform
---------
The pairing of specific hardware with an operating system.

host   - x86 based hardware executing a supported linux operating system
target - ARM Cortex-A9 based RCE harware executing the LINUX operating system

Images
------
One of the supported binary image types compiled for execution on a
target platform.

Tools
-----
Scripts and executables intended for use on a host platform.

SDK Installation
================

Choose SDK installation directory
---------------------------------
$ cd <install_dir>

Download and unpack the SDK to your host platform
----------------------------------------------

The SDK can be copied from:
/afs/slac/www/projects/CTK/SDK/rce-sdk-latest.tar.gz

or over the web:
wget http://www.slac.stanford.edu/projects/CTK/SDK/rce-sdk-latest.tar.gz

tar -xzf rce-sdk-latest.tar.gz

Initialize the SDK environment
------------------------------
$ source <install_dir>/i86-linux-64/tools/envs-sdk.[c]sh

Sourcing of envs-sdk.[c]sh sets the following required environment variables:
PATH  = <install_dir>/<platform>/bin:${PATH}

You are now ready to program using the SDK

SDK Contents
============

bin/
This directory contains host executables and scripts that must be
found via your host's PATH environment variable.  Execution of
<install_dir>/<platform>/tools/envs-sdk.[c]sh will set your host's PATH environment
variable properly.

include/
This directory contains target include directories and header files
that are to be specified at target image compile time using -I.

lib/
This directory contains pre-built target libraries that can be
specified at target image link time using -l.

tgt/
This directory contains pre-built target images that must reside on
the target filesystem.

tools/
This directory contains installation/maintenance scripts that can be
executed on any supported host platform.
